"""Spawn and track WatchTower workers.

A *worker* is a subprocess running an agent CLI (``claude`` or ``codex``) with a
canonical drain goal: claim the oldest open ticket in a queue, do the work,
close it, repeat until the queue is empty. The worker claims under its own id so
the queue's progress signal (closes) reflects real draining.

We track the workers THIS WatchTower CLI started in ``~/.watchtower/workers.json``
so ``wt workers`` can report PID + queue. Liveness here is process-level
(``os.kill(pid, 0)``) — distinct from the queue's stuck signal, which is pure
queue ground-truth.

    """Reopen in_progress tickets whose claiming worker is no longer alive.

    A worker that dies, crashes, or is reaped mid-ticket leaves its ticket
    stranded as ``in_progress`` forever — ``claim_next`` only picks ``open``, so
    nothing re-drains it and nothing closes it. The queue then reads depth=0
    ("Ready") while work is genuinely unfinished. This sweep is the durable fix:
    any in_progress ticket whose ``claimed_by`` worker_id is a KNOWN spawned
    worker (present in the tracked worker store, dead or alive) but is no
    longer alive (and that was claimed longer ago than ``grace_s``, to avoid a
    spawn/claim race) is reopened so a fresh worker re-claims it.

    A ``claimed_by`` id that never appears in the worker store at all — e.g. a
    plain ``wt claim --worker <alias>`` run from an ambient Claude session that
    was never launched via ``spawn_workers``/``spawn_run_once_worker`` — has no
    pid this sweep can check, so "not in the live set" would always be true for
    it regardless of whether the session is still working. Treating that as
    orphaned reopened the ticket ~2 minutes after every such claim, handing it
    to a second worker while the original session kept going — duplicate work
    (OPS-104). Those ids are left alone; if the claiming session really did
    die, the ticket just stays in_progress like a `wt block`ed one already does.

    Loads the registry + live workers + queue depths and for each registered
    queue decides:
      - desired = desired_workers (default 1) if auto_drain AND depth > 0 else 0
      - if actual_live < desired: spawn the delta (or record in dry_run)

    Wind-down (drain/surplus) is deliberately NOT decided here. Counting only
    `open` on a busy queue is a bet on the future — a worker that just claimed
    the last ticket would be STOPped prematurely. The surplus decision is made
    at claim time (``cli.cmd_claim``: nothing claimable AND live>desired), and
    graceful release is the idle safety net. So ``result["stopped"]`` stays
    empty from the reconciler; the key + its log rendering remain for callers.

    Returns ``{"spawned": [...], "stopped": [...], "skipped": [...]}``.
    ``skipped`` entries explain why a queue was left alone (e.g. auto_drain=off,
    depth=0, or surplus resolved elsewhere).  In ``dry_run`` mode no subprocesses
    are started; the return value shows what *would* happen.

    Passes are serialized under a cross-process file lock. The daemon tick and
    ``dispatch_after_enqueue`` (``wt add``) can reconcile concurrently; without
    the lock both read the same live count and each spawns the full desired
    delta, over-spawning the queue (WT-75: 4 spawned for desired=2).
    ``spawn_workers`` persists every worker via ``record_worker()`` before the
    lock is released, so a blocked pass sees the fresh workers and skips.
