# WatchTower

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**Run fleets of AI coding-agent workers, unattended.** File tickets into named queues. Workers drain them automatically. `wt status` shows which queues are stuck: nothing more, nothing less.

The engine is a single durable JSON queue (append-only, file-locked): stdlib-only Python, zero runtime dependencies. WatchTower is a standalone product. It does not require [Claude Command Center](https://github.com/amirfish1/claude-command-center) or any other desktop app to run; every command below works from a plain terminal. A couple of optional integrations (an HTTP delegate for one alternate messaging transport, a shared model-default file) light up automatically if CCC happens to be installed on the same machine, and are called out explicitly where they appear. Nothing in the core queue, worker, or dashboard path depends on them.

## The 30-second demo

The signature feature is `wt wait`: it blocks until a queue has zero open tickets, so you can gate a script on a fleet of agents finishing their work. See it end to end, with no agent CLI required, in one script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirfish1/watchtower.git
cd watchtower && pip install -e .
./examples/quickstart-demo.sh
```

It files a ticket, starts `wt wait` in the background, claims and closes the ticket (standing in for a real worker), and shows `wt wait` unblock the instant the queue empties. Read [`examples/quickstart-demo.sh`](examples/quickstart-demo.sh); it is a plain shell script, nothing hidden.

## Quick start (3 steps)

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, macOS or Linux. An agent CLI, [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), is only needed once you want WatchTower to spawn real AI workers instead of draining tickets yourself.

```bash
# 1. Install
git clone https://github.com/amirfish1/watchtower.git
cd watchtower && pip install -e .

# 2. Create a queue, point it at your repo
wt set -q MYAPP --repo-path /path/to/your/repo --engine claude
wt drain on MYAPP      # enable auto-drain + start the service

# 3. File your first ticket
wt add -q MYAPP --title "Fix the login page" --type bug
```

That's it. A Claude worker spawns automatically in `/path/to/your/repo` and starts draining. Open the dashboard to watch:

```bash
wt dashboard    # opens http://127.0.0.1:8787 in your browser
```

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirfish1/watchtower.git
cd watchtower
pip install -e .     # installs the `wt` CLI
wt --version
```

### Service (background watcher + reconciler)

```bash
wt start        # starts the service; installs the LaunchAgent on first run
wt uninstall    # remove the LaunchAgent
```

There's no separate install step: the first `wt start` (or `wt drain on`,
which starts the service too) writes and loads a macOS LaunchAgent so the
watcher starts on every login and restarts on crash. Re-running `wt start`
later just (re)starts the already-installed service.

```bash
wt stop     # stop it
wt status   # check service + queue health
```

If you'd rather write the LaunchAgent without starting it, `wt install` still
works, but it's a hidden command now: `wt start` is the path everyone should
use.

### Agent skills (Claude Code + Codex + Antigravity)

The first `wt start` also syncs the bundled skills into every agent harness
present on the machine (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`,
`~/.gemini/skills/` for Antigravity), so any session, regardless of which
repo it's rooted in, can use them without being told about `wt` first.
Each is a symlink to the copy inside the installed package, so a `git pull`
(editable install) or package upgrade updates it everywhere instantly with no
separate re-sync step. Four skills ship today:

- **`watchtower`**: look up a ticket by ref (`wt find HERMES-20`), check
  queue health, file/claim/close tickets.
- **`wt-triage-queue`**: unstick a queue that's flagged stuck or has aging,
  abandoned, or unclosed claims.
- **`critique`** (`/critique` in any synced harness): spawn two
  cross-family agents that independently critique a plan/design/diff and
  report back via `wt send`. Wraps `wt critique`; the reports arrive
  asynchronously (`wt critique --json` returns the spawned worker records
  for scripted callers, and each critic's log file holds the raw output).
- **`group-chat-checkin`**: coordinate parallel sessions for discussion,
  task execution, and git commits.

```bash
wt skills sync      # same sync `wt install` runs; safe to re-run anytime
wt skills status    # show what's linked, without changing anything
wt skills remove    # undo: removes only the symlinks wt manages
```

See [`docs/agent-discovery.md`](docs/agent-discovery.md) for the design
rationale (why a skill, not just a repo convention or an MCP server).

### Browser annotation widget (optional)

Drop `contrib/annotate-widget.js` into your project to let users file tickets directly from the browser with a single click. See [`contrib/annotate-widget.md`](contrib/annotate-widget.md).

## Usage

```bash
wt status                              # per-queue depth, oldest-open age, stuck flag
wt ls -q DEMO                          # list tickets in a queue
wt find DEMO-1                         # look up one ticket by ref, no -q needed

wt add -q DEMO --title "Fix nav" \
       --text "navbar overlaps on mobile" --type bug

wt import plan.md -q DEMO                 # preview document tasks
wt import plan.md -q DEMO --apply         # file only new tasks

wt edit   DEMO-1 --priority p0 --type feature  # patch fields on an existing ticket
wt edit   DEMO-1 --queue OTHER                 # move to a different queue in place (reassigns ref)

wt claim  -q DEMO                      # claim the next open ticket (smart sort)
wt claim  -q DEMO DEMO-1               # claim a specific ticket by ref
wt run    DEMO-1                       # mark an existing GitHub issue runnable
wt close  DEMO-1 --summary "fixed the overlap" --commit <SHA>
wt close  DEMO-1 --summary "documented the decision" --no-code
wt close  DEMO-1 --summary "fixed the overlap" --commit <SHA> \
          --caveat "only tested on iOS" --follow-up "add a regression test"

wt drain on DEMO                       # enable auto-drain for a queue
wt drain off DEMO                      # disable auto-drain
wt set -q DEMO --repo-path /path/to/repo --engine claude

wt workers                             # list workers the watcher started
wt wait   -q DEMO --timeout 600 --cmd "say done" # block until drained, then run cmd

wt start                               # start the watcher; installs the LaunchAgent on first run
wt stop                                # stop the watcher
wt uninstall                           # remove the LaunchAgent
wt dashboard                           # open the night-watch dashboard (non-blocking)
wt dashboard --no-open                 # ensure the server is up, don't open a browser
wt skills sync                         # (re-)sync the bundled skills into installed harnesses
```

### Import a document into a queue

`wt import` sends the complete document through one Claude reasoning call. It
infers explicit and implicit work, chooses ticket-sized units that one worker
session can complete coherently, and preserves dependency order. Checkboxes,
headings, and numbered steps are hints rather than parsing rules.

The command previews the full reasoned ticket set by default. Pass `--apply`
to file it and optionally `--type bug|feature` to override every inferred type.
The locally authenticated `claude` CLI must be available. A missing CLI,
timeout, malformed response, invalid source anchor, or invalid dependency fails
loudly before any ticket is filed. Imports use Sonnet in Claude safe mode by
default; set `WATCHTOWER_IMPORT_MODEL` to override the model. `--tools ""` alone
is not an isolation boundary: Claude Code may still load local skills, plugins,
and project instructions. Keep `--safe-mode` on the importer invocation so that
ambient local context cannot consume the import budget.

```bash
wt import docs/launch-plan.md -q LAUNCH
wt import docs/launch-plan.md -q LAUNCH --apply --type feature
```

Each ticket records the resolved source file and line anchor. A stable source
key makes repeat imports safe: importing the same document again creates no
duplicates, while newly inferred document tasks create new tickets.

### Agent engines

WatchTower supports two agent engines. Set the engine per queue with `wt set`:

```bash
wt set -q MYAPP --engine claude    # default: Claude Code (stream-json, FIFO, live)
wt set -q MYAPP --engine codex     # OpenAI Codex (one-shot exec)
```

The engine is stored in `~/.watchtower/queue-config.json` and picked up by the
reconciler on the next spawn. Existing live workers are unaffected until they
are released from queue staffing and a replacement is started.

#### `claude` (default)

Requires the [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) (`claude` on `$PATH`).

Workers are spawned as:

```
claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json \
       --verbose --permission-mode bypassPermissions
```

The drain goal is delivered as the **first stream-json message** on a named pipe
(FIFO) that is the worker's stdin. This makes the worker a **live, pushable
process**: when `wt add` files a new ticket while the worker is idle, the
message arrives on the FIFO immediately, with no polling and no sleep loop; warm
context is preserved. The worker's prompt cache stays hot for ~5 minutes after
the last claim (Anthropic's cache TTL), so tickets that arrive in that window
are cheaper and faster to handle.

Cache warmth does not control staffing. After 30 minutes of verified inactivity,
the reconciler gracefully releases the conversation from this queue without
killing it; later work gets replacement staffing as needed.

#### `codex`

Requires the [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (`codex` on
`$PATH`).

Workers are spawned as:

```
codex exec <drain-goal>
```

The drain goal is passed directly as the command-line argument (one-shot exec).
There is no FIFO stdin channel and no live push notification: the worker drains
until the queue is empty, performs the idle audit, completes the active drain
goal, and exits immediately. New tickets filed while it is running are picked up
on the next `wt claim` loop iteration. `wt add` notifications are not delivered
to a running codex worker.

#### Comparison

| | `claude` | `codex` |
|---|---|---|
| Spawn mode | stream-json over FIFO | `exec <goal>` |
| Live push (`wt add`) | yes, via FIFO | no |
| Prompt cache warm wake | yes (~5 min) | no |
| Multi-ticket session | yes, one process, warm ctx | one process, warm ctx |
| Requires | Claude Code CLI | OpenAI Codex CLI |

### GitHub Issues backend (optional)

A queue can use GitHub Issues instead of the local JSON queue file. WatchTower
still exposes the same commands; behind the scenes `wt add` creates an issue,
`wt claim` assigns it, and `wt close` closes it with a resolution comment.

So yes: closing a GitHub-backed ticket closes the corresponding GitHub Issue.
The required `--summary` plus a completion proof (`--commit <SHA>` for code
changes or `--no-code` for non-code work), and any caveats, follow-ups, or
unresolved items, are posted as that issue's resolution comment and retained in
WatchTower's metadata for the dashboard and CLI history.

```bash
gh auth login
wt set -q MYAPP --backend github --github-repo owner/repo

wt add -q MYAPP --title "Fix checkout" --text "Steps to reproduce..."
wt run MYAPP-123                       # run this issue now (overrides drain/grace)
wt claim -q MYAPP --worker worker-1
wt close MYAPP-123 --worker worker-1 --summary "fixed the null state" --commit <SHA>
```

GitHub-backed refs use the issue number (`MYAPP-123` is issue `#123`). A
GitHub-backed queue lists open issues plus issues completed in the last 14 days
from the configured repository, so GitHub is the visible storage layer.

Whether a ticket gets worked comes from three independent inputs, not from a
whitelist label:

| Input | Lives on | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `auto_drain` (`wt drain on\|off MYAPP`) | queue | off |
| `watchtower:no-auto-drain` | issue label | absent |
| `watchtower:play` (`wt run MYAPP-123`) | issue label | absent |
| `grace_s` (`wt config -q MYAPP --grace-s 180`) | queue | 180s |

```
auto_eligible   = auto_drain AND NOT no-auto-drain AND age >= grace_s
manual_eligible = run_requested            # wt run / the dashboard Run action
work_it         = auto_eligible OR manual_eligible
```

So a queue with drain on works every open issue except the ones labelled
`watchtower:no-auto-drain`, and leaves brand-new issues alone for `grace_s`
seconds so a human can label them first. `wt run MYAPP-123` overrides all
three. The old `watchtower:<QUEUE>` label no longer admits anything; it is
only still read when two or more queues point at the *same* repo, where it is
the only way to say which issue belongs to which queue. Turning drain on for a
**public** repo prints a warning first — agents will work strangers' issues.
Claims assign the issue to `@me` by default; override with
`wt set -q MYAPP --github-assignee USERNAME`.

`wt status` shows, per queue, depth (open) / WIP / done, oldest-open age, idle
time, a `WORKERS` column (`total (n live)`), and a STUCK/draining/ok flag,
followed by a **drain readout** (`~3/min · empty in ~20m`, or `stalled` when no
ticket has closed recently). Then a workers section listing each tracked
worker's id, queue, pid, LIVE/DEAD state (process liveness via
`os.kill(pid, 0)`), and what it is doing right now: `-> DASH-3 (4m)` (the
in-progress ticket it holds and how long ago it claimed it) or `idle`.

### Drain rate + ETA

WatchTower turns the queue's own close timestamps into a live estimate, so
`wt status` and the dashboard read like a forecast rather than a static count:

- **drain rate**: tickets closed in the last 30 minutes (a fixed window) over
  the window, i.e. closes/min.
- **ETA**: `depth / drain_rate`, rendered as `~20m` / `~2h`; `stalled` (null in
  JSON) when nothing has closed in the window.

These are computed from data already in the queue (`closed_at` timestamps); no
new persistent state, no transcript parsing. `/api/status` carries
`drain_rate_per_min`, `eta_seconds`, and `eta_human` on each queue, and
`active_ref` / `active_since_human` on each worker.

### The dashboard: `wt dashboard`

```bash
wt dashboard [--port 8787] [--host 127.0.0.1]
             [--no-open] [--stop] [--foreground] [--once]
```

`wt dashboard` is a **night-watch operations console**: a calm, dark instrument
panel over your agent fleet that lights up like a beacon when a queue stalls.
It does **not** block your terminal:

1. Starts the HTTP server **detached** in the background if it isn't already
   running (idempotent: a second `wt dashboard` won't start a second server),
   recording its pid in `~/.watchtower/dashboard.pid` (override with
   `$WATCHTOWER_DASHBOARD_PID`).
2. Opens your browser to the URL (`webbrowser.open`).
3. Prints the URL and returns immediately.

Flags:

- `--no-open`: ensure the server is up, but don't open a browser.
- `--stop`: stop the background dashboard server (via the pidfile).
- `--foreground`: run the server in the foreground (blocking), for debugging.
- `--once`: handle a single request then exit (used by the test suite).
- `--host` / `--port`: bind address (default `127.0.0.1:8787`, local-first).

The watcher can host it too: `wt start --dashboard` brings the dashboard up
alongside the watcher in one process (`--host`/`--port` apply there as well).

**The page** (stdlib-only `http.server`, no dependencies, auto-refreshes ~5s):

- A **tower** header: the `WatchTower` wordmark with a beacon dot (calm green
  normally, amber when any queue is stuck) and a mono fleet summary
  (`3 queues · 1 stuck · 2 workers live`).
- A responsive **instrument grid**: one card per queue with a big mono readout
  (`7 open · empty in ~14m`, `STALLED`, or `clear`), a slim drain bar, and a
  live-worker count. A **stuck** card gets an amber accent border and a slow
  pulsing beacon glow (respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`).
- A **workers** section: worker id (mono), queue, activity (`-> SHIP-3 (4m)` or
  `idle`), and a LIVE / DEAD pill.
- **Drill-down**: clicking a queue card opens `/q/<queue>`, listing that
  queue's active tickets (ref / status / worker / title) and, below them, a
  **Closed** section where each row shows its resolution summary + chips.
- An **empty state** that reads as an invitation, not an error: a dim beacon and
  "All queues clear".

It also exposes read-only JSON:

- `GET /api/status`: health rows (each annotated with worker counts) + the
  worker roster.
- `GET /api/queues`: per-queue counts (mirrors `wt queues`).
- `GET /api/queue/<name>`: the active tickets in one queue plus a `closed`
  array (each closed item carries its `resolution`).

### Resolutions: record HOW a ticket was fixed

Closing a ticket is also where a worker records *what it did*: the trust-layer
signal that turns a drained queue into an auditable log.

```bash
wt close DEMO-1 --summary "rewrote the flex container" --commit <SHA> \
         --caveat "watch the sticky footer on Safari" \
         --follow-up "add a visual regression test" \
         --unresolved "the print stylesheet still clips"
```

`--summary` is the one-liner. Every close also needs exactly one proof:
`--commit <SHA>` validates and records the code-change commit in the ticket's
repository; `--no-code` explicitly records that the work changed no code.
`--caveat`, `--follow-up`, and `--unresolved` are repeatable. The resolution is
stored on the item (`item["resolution"]`) and surfaced in the dashboard's
per-queue **Closed** section and on closed `wt ls` rows. If a verified change
cannot be committed, block the ticket with progress instead of closing it.

Pass `--enqueue-follow-ups` to also file each follow-up / unresolved item as a
new open ticket in the same queue (opt-in), so loose ends don't get lost.

The drill-down page (`/q/<queue>`) lists active tickets, then a **Closed**
section (most-recent first) where each row shows its summary with small chips for
caveats / follow-ups / unresolved. `GET /api/queue/<name>` returns both the
active `tickets` and the `closed` array (closed items carry their `resolution`).

### The signature feature: `wt wait`

`wt wait -q DEMO` blocks (polling) until the queue has zero open tickets, then
exits 0, optionally running a `--cmd` afterward. Drop it at the end of a script
to gate on a fleet of agents finishing their work. [`examples/quickstart-demo.sh`](examples/quickstart-demo.sh)
runs this exact flow start to finish.

## Cross-agent messaging

Queues move work; messaging moves conversation. WatchTower can push a message
to any agent session, ask one a question and wait for the answer, and run
multi-agent group chats where the daemon (deterministically, no LLM
moderator) nudges the right participants to respond.

```bash
wt send @planner "heads up: schema changed, re-read models.py"
wt ask  @reviewer "is PR 42 safe to merge?" --timeout 60
wt agents                        # named registry + workers + last-3-days sessions
wt agents register planner --session <uuid>  # set-name is an alias for register

wt chat new "release plan" --with @planner,@reviewer --include-human
wt chat post <ref> "let's cut v0.2 tonight"
wt chat read <ref> --tail 20
wt chat ls / add / leave / nudge / archive / close
```

Targets are a worker id, a registered `@name`, or any session UUID (or unique
prefix). Any session on disk is reachable; liveness is not required.

Delivery falls through three adapters:

1. **fifo**: the target is a live WatchTower worker, message goes straight
   down its stdin pipe.
2. **resume**: `claude --resume` headless, with a busy-hold: if the target's
   transcript changed in the last 120s the message waits in a durable outbox
   and is delivered the moment the session goes quiet (never forks a parallel
   turn).
3. **delegate** (optional): an HTTP endpoint (`$WATCHTOWER_DELEGATE_URL`, or
   auto-detected from a local Claude Command Center) for instant injection
   into live terminal tabs and for non-Claude engines. Unset and undetected
   means fully standalone; `off` disables it explicitly.

Undeliverable messages persist in `~/.watchtower/outbox.json` and are retried
by the daemon with backoff (dead-lettered after 20 attempts, visible in the
activity log).

Group chats are file-compatible with CCC group chats (same markdown + JSON
sidecar under `~/.claude/group-chats` when present), so both tools can serve
the same conversations. Per-engine feasibility ground truth lives in
[`docs/engine-capability-matrix.md`](docs/engine-capability-matrix.md).

## Where the queue lives

WatchTower resolves its store in this order:

1. `$WATCHTOWER_STORE`: explicit override (used by tests/CI).
2. The existing CCC store at `~/.claude/command-center/ux-fixes-queue.json`
   **if it already exists** on this machine, so WatchTower drains real work
   today without migration.
3. `~/.watchtower/queues.json`: WatchTower's own default, used whenever no CCC
   store is present. A fresh install with no CCC on the machine always lands
   here.

Tracked workers live in `~/.watchtower/workers.json`; the watcher daemon's
pidfile is `~/.watchtower/daemon.pid`, and the background dashboard server's is
`~/.watchtower/dashboard.pid`.

## Stuck detection

A queue is **stuck** when it has open tickets AND no ticket has been closed in
the last 10 minutes. This is pure queue ground-truth: WatchTower decides from
the queue file alone, with no dependency on any external liveness signal.

## Roadmap

- **Tap-to-act / buttons**: claim, close, or requeue tickets from the dashboard UI.
- **Cost / token tracking**: per-queue and per-worker spend.
- **Push notifications**: alert on a queue going stuck or draining.
- **MCP server**: a structured, versioned tool API (`wt_find`, `wt_status`,
  `wt_claim`, ...) as the longer-term follow-up to the CLI + skill combo
  above, for harnesses without shell access. See
  [`docs/agent-discovery.md`](docs/agent-discovery.md) for the full option
  comparison and why the skill (now shipped) was the right near-term move.
